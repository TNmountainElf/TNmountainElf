- 👋 Hi, I’m @TNmountainElf, an over-educated hillbilly from southern Appalachia.
      Education: BS/MS/ABD Geology/Chemistry/Environmental Science  Work History: Environmental Regulation, Freelance Artist
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded systems for agriculture and environmental monitoring.  And random other stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ for embedded linux.  
      Some previous exposure to C/C++ on linux from an undergrad level advanced programming course.
      And about 15 years of using linux.  I don't do windows.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something related to any of the above.
- 📫 How to reach me ... cumberlandMtnArt@gmail.com

I also promise to update this to something a little more interesting and a little less stock after I've kicked the tires around here a bit.
